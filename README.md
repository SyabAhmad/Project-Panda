# Project-Panda

# There are two type Dataframes

```Series``` and ```DataFrames```

```Series``` are ```1D``` labeled ```homogeneously-typed``` array and 

```Dataframes``` are General ```2D``` labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially ```heterogeneously-typed``` column

# Creation od series and Data Frames

# To import Panda 

```python runable
import pandas as pd

```

# To create Series

```python runable
import pandas as pd
# will create a series of data
data = pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
# will print the data
print(data)

```

# To print type of data

```python runable
# will print the type of data objects
print(type(data))

```
# To create Dataframe

```python runable
import pandas as pd
# will create a series of data
data = pd.Dataframe(["Column1": [1,2,3,4,5,6], "Column2": [1,2,3,4,5,6]], index=['a','b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'])
# will print the data
print(data)

```

# To print type of data

```python runable
# will print the type of data objects
print(type(data))

```

# To create Seriese from day 1 and day 2 only
```python runable
import pandas as pd

calories = {"day1": 420, "day2": 380, "day3": 390}

myvar = pd.Series(calories, index = ["day1", "day2"])

print(myvar)
```

# Example of Data Frame # #1
```python runable
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
print("Creation of Data Frames")

data = pd.DataFrame({
    "Names": np.array(["Syab", "Fayaz", "Adeel", "Eyad", "Rehan"]),
    "Age": np.array([23, 25, 16, 13, 12]),
    "sex": np.array(["male","male","male","male","male",])
})

print(data)

```
# Example of Data Frame # #1 Continue
```python runable

# to print specific column
print(data["Age"])
print(data["Names"])
print(data["sex"])

# to describe and find max and min
print(data.describe())
print(data.max())
print(data.min())

# selecting subset from dataframe
data1 = data['Names']
print(data1)

```
